-refer to Anna's notebook for updated type 1 attack in terms of correctness
-resolve bug that happens when training on attack 3 
-test grad norm detection on type 1 and 2 attacks

-has done detection via feature. She will continue with her projectory calculation

-Contribution repo working\
-Implement DP-SGD and how that affects performance while the attack is going on\
\
-Testing attacks on ShapleyFL\
-Using DP-SGD for local client privacy\
-Using DC-GAN for Private Synthetic Data Generation for privately sharing test dataset with server
