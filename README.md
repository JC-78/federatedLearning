-Adversarial attack detection
-Scaling based on contribution

Josh:

-implement other attack detection methods
-review Anna's existing detection methods and integrate them into our ensemble detection
-Collect baseline result

Anna:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KYY8VZuFyUnQUPdiymANRI82_9iFqPK5?usp=sharing
-has done detection via feature. She will continue with her projectory calculation

Yash:
-Contribution repo working
-Implement DP-SGD and how that affects performance while the attack is going on
